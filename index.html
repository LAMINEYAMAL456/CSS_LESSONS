        <p>I  am Chierika. Collision theory states that the speed of chemical reactions is related to the
        number of successful collisions. A successful or effective collision just means that the particles
         were oriented correctly and activation energy was achieved. So, the more successful collisions that
          occur, the faster the reaction rate.</p>
